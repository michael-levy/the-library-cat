          4. Aliens are probably real confused rn
        </a>
        <p>
          In sci-fi, aliens always seem to recieve our media. If they can hear
          our radio, they're <em>in </em>
          the solar system. But! Before the cold war, line of sight radar was
          fine, nothing could hurt you if you couldn't see it. Then people
          invented nukes and suddenly annihilation could sneak up on you in the
          same way the sun does. Except different, because nuclear bombers
          aren't stars? Anyway, to fix this they started bouncing off the
          atmosphere, like TVs and radios do. To hit a small object on the other
          side of the horizon, you need quite a lot of power. And reflecting
          isn't very efficient, most of it goes into space. So humans have been
          blasting short wave radio signals into space, which will be really
          annoying for any aliens that find it, because they don't mean
          anything. Sorry aliens. Here's Russia's array, built in 2014:

          3. Manta rays are seven meters in diameter
        </a>
        <p>
          You know how large that is? Very large! That's 3.8 Taika Waititis!
          There aren't 3.8 Taikas anywhere! There's only one! In Australia, I
          think. So not even easily accessible. While we're sort of allowed to
          go to Australia it's probably really annoying at the moment and also
          flights are always so expensive! So even if I wanted to compare a
          manta ray to 3.8 Taikas, which to be honest isn't high on my bucket
          list, I wouldn't be able to. I found this out from this song:

          2. Trees are a lie
        </a>
        <p>
          TREES are a LIE. They don't exist. Plants keep randomly turning into
          trees and trees keep randomly turning back into plants. Cinnamon and
          avocados have a relatively recent common ancestor which is a tree. The
          most common ancestor of apples and peaches was probably not a tree.
          Scientists have poked the DNA of a bush and it turned into a tree.
          Everything is chaos.

          1. Look at this cool plant
        </a>
        <p>
          It lives for TWO THOUSAND years. That's longer than the Roman Empire
          lasted. It only grows TWO LEAVES. That's as many leaves as I have
          ears! The leaves just keep growing, forever, until they get real large
          and tattered. Their name in Africaans is Tweeblaarkanniedood, which is
          incredible.
