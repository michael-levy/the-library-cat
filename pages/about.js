      <h1>Hello</h1>

      <p>
        I'm Michael. I read books and write code. This website is the happy
        intersection of the two.
      </p>
      <p>
        I read almost exclusively sci-fi and fantasy, more out of habit than
        design. My favourite author is Sanderson, which is awfully boring of me.
