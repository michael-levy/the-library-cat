        Firstly: You should perform the Conjuration in your mother tongue, or in
        a language that you well understand, and conjure the Spirits by the
        authority of and their obedience to the Holy Patriarchs, rehearsing unto
        them examples of their ruin and fall, of the sentence which God hath
        pronounced against them, and of their obligation unto servitude; and how
        on one side and on another they have been vanquished by the Good Angels
        and by Wise Men; all which points you will have had plenty of
        opportunity to study in the Sacred Writings during the Six Moons (of
        preparation). Also you shall menace them, in case they are unwilling to
        obey, with calling unto your aid the Power of the Holy Angels over them.
        Your Guardian Angel will also have instructed you to perform this
        Convocation with modesty, and in no wise to be timid, but courageous,
        yet in moderation, however, without too overbearing hardiness and
        bravery. And in case of their being inclined to resist, and unwilling to
        obey you, you must not on that account give way to anger, because thus
        you will only do injury to yourself; and they will ask nothing better,
        it being exactly what they would be endeavouring to do; but (on the
        contrary) with an intrepid heart, and putting your whole trust in God,
        with a tranquil heart you shall exhort them to yield, letting them see
        that you have put all your confidence in the Living and Only God,
        reminding them how powerful and potent He is; thus, therefore, govern
        yourself, using prudence towards them. And communicate unto them also
        the Form in the which you wish them to appear; the which you can not
        determine, nor even themselves, but you ought the evening before to have
        demanded this from your Guardian Angel, who knoweth better than you your
        nature and constitution, and who understandeth the forms which can
        terrify you, and those of which you can support the sight. And you must
        not think that this can he done otherwise, as certain Accursed Persons
        write; that is to say, by means of Seals, and Conjurations, and
        Superstitious Figures, and Pentacles, and other Abominations, written by
        Diabolical Enchanters; for this would be the coin wherewith the Hideous
        SATAN would buy you for his slave. But let your whole trust be in the
        Arm, the Power, and the Force of God Almighty; then shall you be in all
        safety, and the Guard of your Angel will defend you from all dangers.
        This is why you should have good courage, and have confidence that no
        adversity can happen unto you. Observing then the doctrine that your
        Angel will have given unto you, and persevering in placing all your
        trust in God, at length I will appear in the form commanded upon the
        Terrace, upon the sand; when, according to the advice and doctrine
        received from your Holy Angel.
